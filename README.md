# SimpleFramework



A set of code with common and useful tasks...


If you need a class to manipulate your 

* appconfig, 
* imaging, 
* xml, 
* file system, 
* PDF generation, 
* fileupload, 
* grid on a webpage, 
* http, 
* ftp, 
* smtp, 
* websocket, 
* webcrawler, 
* authentication, 
* authorization, 
* roles, 
* security, 
* or anything basic, repeated that every business line project has we have it.


The goal here is to have a code repository that makes things simple. No DDD or or patterns for building rockets to go to Mars.

Did you need something that doesn't exactly remember how it works? Copy and paste the class. Be happy. 


Initially I had the idea to make several helper methods and also extension classes. 

The project is just beginning. 

Suggestions are welcome. Make your pull request.
