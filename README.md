# SimpleFramework



A set of code with common and useful tasks...


If you need a class to manipulate your appconfig, image manipulation, xml manipulation, file system, PDF generation, Grid on a webpage or anything basic, 
repeated that every business line project has we have it.


The goal here is to have a code repository that makes things simple. 
Did you need something that doesn't exactly remember how it works? Copy and paste the class. Be happy. 


Initially I had the idea to make several helper methods and also extension classes. 

The project is just beginning. 

Suggestions are welcome. Make your pull request.
